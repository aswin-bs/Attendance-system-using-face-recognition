# Face Recognition System

This project implements a simple face recognition system using Python and OpenCV.

## Instructions
1. Run the `face_rec.ipynb` notebook to perform face recognition.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., OpenCV, face_recognition).
3. Add images to the `student_images` folder for recognition.

## Usage
- The system captures faces through the webcam and compares them with stored images.
- Detected faces are labeled with the corresponding student's name.

## Acknowledgements
- This project uses face_recognition library for face recognition.
